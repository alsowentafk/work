Hey, 

Thanks for posting Adidas × Raf Simons RAF SIMONS RISING STAR 2 on Grailed! We just checked and it looks like you haven’t created a PayPal account for alsowentafk@gmail.com yet. It's super easy to do, just go to https://paypal.com , sign up and confirm your email. 

You can change the PayPal email on your account by clicking 'edit item' and putting a different email in the 'paypal' field. 

Let me know if you have any questions!

But I have all confirmed how I can solve it?
